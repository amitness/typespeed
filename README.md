![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true)

A typing game where displayed words should be typed as fast as possible. You lose if five mistakes are made. 

The words gets tougher each time as the level upgrades. The main objective is to get as much score as you can.

### Backstory
Mini project developed for the *Intro to Programming in C* course during 1<sup>st</sup> semester, 2014. 

The challenge was to use basic features of C and only standard library. We made use of ASCII art for graphical effect.

### Features
- The faster you type, the higher you score
- Word complexity increases on increasing level
- Loading screen using ASCII animations
- Mouse driven selection in menu
- Random placement of words
